## Ring level

  * 100 TOO_FEW_POINTS            ring has <3 points
  * 110 CONSECUTIVE_POINTS_SAME   2 consecutive points are the same 
  * 120 RING_NOT_CLOSED           first-last points are not the same 
  * 130 RING_SELF_INTERSECT       ring self-intersects or is collapsed to a point or a line 

## Surface level (one polygon embedded in 3D)

  * 200 SELF_INTERSECTION      rings of the surface intersect
  * 210 NON_PLANAR_SURFACE     surface is not planar
  * 220 INTERIOR_DISCONNECTED  interior of surface is not connected
  * 230 HOLE_OUTSIDE           1 or more holes are located outside the extering
  * 240 HOLES_ARE_NESTED       holes of the surface are nested inside other
  * 250 ORIENTATION_RINGS_SAME exterior and interior rings have same orientation

## Shell level (one envelop formed by several surfaces)

  * 301  SURFACE_NOT_CLOSED                     there is 1+ 'hole' somewhere on the surface 
  * 302  DANGLING_FACES                         dangling faces (more than 2 surfaces incident to an edge) 
  * 303  FACE_ORIENTATION_INCORRECT_EDGE_USAGE  orientation of one or more faces not correct 
  * 304  FREE_FACES                             1+ faces not connected to the others (eg 'floating' in the air) or duplicate faces 
  * 305  SURFACE_SELF_INTERSECTS                surface self-intersect
  * 306  VERTICES_NOT_USED                      some vertices are not referenced by the faces
  * 310  SURFACE_NORMALS_WRONG_ORIENTATION      normals all pointing in wrong direction

## Solid level (1 exterior shell + [0..*n*] interior shells)

  * 400  SHELLS_FACE_ADJACENT            2+ shells are face adjacent
  * 410  SHELL_INTERIOR_INTERSECT        2+ shell overlap 
  * 420  INNER_SHELL_OUTSIDE_OUTER       1+ interior shell is located totally outside the exterior shell
  * 430  INTERIOR_OF_SHELL_NOT_CONNECTED interior of the solid not connected
