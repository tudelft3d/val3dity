# test case
test_file_format:
  "poly_hole": .poly unit cube with invalid definition of the hole in the top face. TetView doesnt open the file with an error as Hole 1 in facet 1 has no coordinatesNothing to draw!

test_geometry_generic:

  "102": Cube with one duplicate vertex (repeated in a ring)
  "104": Unit cube where top face has a bow tie
  "104_1": Unit cube with top face having a self-intersecting surface (2D invalid), where 2 out of 3 triangles that are forming a square are bundled as one polygon (which self-intersects)
  "104_2": One face closing in itself before the last vertex
  "104_3": Similar to 104_1 but triangles meet in one corner of the square
  "105": Unit cube with a hole (inner ring) in the top face, where inner ring is collapsed to a line of 3 points
  "105_1": A single 3D polygon collapsed into a line
  "105_2": As 105_2, but with 4 points in a line (8-11), the 4th point is intersecting one edge (5-6) (currently val3dity cannot parse it). This is 104 & 105
  "201": Unit cube with intersecting rings in top face
  "201_1": A single 3D polygon with an interior ring that instersects its exterior
  "201_2": Unit cube with a hole in top face located outside and the hole is intersecting the exterior in one point
  "202": Unit cube with a duplicate inner ring top face
  "203": Unit cube where the top face has 5 vertices, one of them (8) is not on the plane of the other 4 (+0.05)
  "203_1": Unit cube with a rectangular hole drilled through it, where one vertex (8) on the inner ring in the top face of the cube is not on the plane of the face (+0.5)
  "203_2": Same as 203 but non-planar vertex is +0.1
  "203_valid": Same as 203 but non-planar vertex is +0.0999
  "204": Unit cube with a hump in the top face, which results in an ~1.4° normal difference
  "204_1": Unit cube with a hump (+0.00699) in the top face, which results in an 1.00114° normal difference
  "204_2": Unit cube with a depression (-0.00699) in the top face, which results in an 1.00114° normal difference
  "204_3": Unit cube with a vertical fold (0.0099) in the top face
  "204_4": Unit cube with a vertical fold (0.0009) in the top face
  "204_valid": Unit cube with a hump (+0.00698) in the top face, which results in an 0.99971° normal difference
  "205": Unit cube with a polygon with interior disconnected in top face
  "206": Unit cube with a hole in top face located outside (in 2D the top face is not acc. to SFS)
  "207": Unit cube with a polygon with nested rings in top face
  "207_1": Unit cube with a polygon with a nested ring in a nested ring in the top face
  "207_2": Same as 207_1 but the holes are defined according to the .poly manual
  "208": Unit cube with a hole (inner ring) in the top face having same orientation as outer ring
  "301": Flat cube, ie with volume of 0, only 2 surfaces

  "302_2": A vertex in the top surface does not close the shell (0.00001 discrepancy), GML cube
  "303": Unit cube with one dangling face touching the cube at one point only. The dangling face is the last in the list
  "303_1": 2 unit cubes touching at one vertex
  "304": Unit cube with an extra vertex on an edge. Only one of the 2 incident faces has it explicitly. Geometrically valid, but topologically invalid, thus invalid. Note that Oracle Spatial reports valid.
  "304_1": Unit cube with one extra face in the middle, splitting the cube in two parts
  "304_2": Unit cube with one corner as a separate part
  "305": Cube with one extra face floating in the air, not touching
  "305_1": 2 unit cubes not touching at all, one above the other separated by 1unit
  "306": House with tip below the ground
  "306_1": House with tip touching the bottom faces
  "306_2": Unit cube with one extra face inside another face
  "306_3": Torus where the hole in the top/bottom faces touches the side surfaces
  "307": Unit cube with one face (face 0) with opposite orientation

  "402": Duplicate unit cubes
  "402_1": Unit cube with duplicate cavities
