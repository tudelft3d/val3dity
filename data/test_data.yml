# test case
test_file_format:
  "poly_hole": .poly unit cube with invalid definition of the hole in the top face. TetView doesnt open the file with an error as Hole 1 in facet 1 has no coordinatesNothing to draw!

test_geometry_generic:
  "101": cube top face a line (with only 2 vertices)
  "102": cube with one duplicate vertex (repeated in a ring)
  "104": unit cube where top face has a bow tie
  "104_1": unit cube with top face having a self-intersecting surface (2D invalid), where 2 out of 3 triangles that are forming a square are 'bundled' as one polygon (which self-intersects)
  "104_2": one face closing in itself before the last vertex
  "104_3": similar to 104_1 but triangles meet in one corner of the square
  "105": unit cube with a hole (inner ring) in the top face, where inner ring is collapsed to a line of 3 points
  "105_1": a single 3D polygon collapsed into a line
  "105_2": as 105_2, but with 4 points in a line (8-11), the 4th point is intersecting one edge (5-6) (currently val3dity cannot parse it). This is 104 & 105
  "201": unit cube with intersecting rings in top face
  "201_1": a single 3D polygon with an interior ring that instersects its exterior
  "201_2": unit cube with a hole in top face located outside and the hole is intersecting the exterior in one point
  "202": unit cube with a duplicate inner ring top face
  "203": unit cube where the top face has 5 vertices, one of them (8) is not on the plane of the other 4 (+0.5)
  "203_1": unit cube with a rectangular hole drilled through it, where one vertex (8) on the inner ring in the top face of the cube is not on the plane of the face (+0.5)
  "203_2": same as 203 but non-planar vertex is +0.1
  "203_valid": same as 203 but non-planar vertex is +0.0999
  "204": unit cube with a hump in the top face, which results in an ~1.4° normal difference
  "204_1": unit cube with a hump (+0.00699) in the top face, which results in an 1.00114° normal difference
  "204_2": unit cube with a depression (-0.00699) in the top face, which results in an 1.00114° normal difference
  "204_3": unit cube with a vertical fold (0.0099) in the top face
  "204_4": unit cube with a vertical fold (0.0009) in the top face
  "204_valid": unit cube with a hump (+0.00698) in the top face, which results in an 0.99971° normal difference
  "205": unit cube with a polygon with interior disconnected in top face
  "206": unit cube with a hole in top face located outside (in 2D the top face is not acc. to SFS)
  "207": unit cube with a polygon with nested rings in top face
  "207_1": unit cube with a polygon with a nested ring in a nested ring in the top face
  "207_2": same as 207_1 but the holes are defined according to the .poly manual
  "208": unit cube with a hole (inner ring) in the top face having same orientation as outer ring
  "302": unit cube with a top surface composed of 2 polygons
#  "304": unit cube with one corner as a disconnected part

# TODO: write composite test for 105_2

test_valid:
  "valid_1": .poly unit cube with comments in it
  "valid_2": .poly unit cube with a hole in the top surface and inline comments
  "valid_3": .poly unit cube with the top surface composed of 2 polygons. TetView can display it correctly as a closed Solid.
  "valid_4": same as 203, but the non-planar vertex on the top face is below the default 0.01 non-planarity threshold
  "self_fold": .obj unit cube with a whirl
